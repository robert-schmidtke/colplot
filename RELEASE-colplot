Modification History

4.9.0 April 1, 2015 (remember from here forward, JUST colplot changes)

- report stacked plots in reverse variable order since the old way
  sometimes some would get overwritten

4.8.3 March 9, 2015

colplot
- added ability to append '-anything' after date/time, making it possible
  to have other plot files co-mingled with standard ones
- plot name for cpumored was cpudmore in the plot by name help and has
  been fixed
- no longer need check to verify plot directory exists because there
  is now logic to allow startup when no plottable files, whether it
  exists or not.  Before this change, if default directory wasn't there
  colplot wouldn't even run and allow you to change it.  Now it will.

colmux 4.8.3
- colmux has been moved to the base collectl kit

4.8.2 November 19, 2014

colmux
- just to be safe, kill all ssh sessions when exiting in real-time mode
- in some cases others may try to connect to colmux, watching for port
  2655 to appear.  if so, accept connection and ignore.  if -quiet the
  warning message will be suppressed
- added Alias line to apache config file so it'd would work with 2.4
- found a problem that goes back awhile, colmux wasn't dealing correctly
  with -P data and so could have been reporting wrong fields
- in single line format
  - added new switch -colnoinst which removes instance portion of column
    headers which can be quite long
  - include names of each variable over set of hostnames
- in multiline format
  - when noescape flag specified, also disable cursor control so we don't
    clobber terminal settings
  - by replacing the leading Time with spaces, I inadvertantly clobbered
    the StartTime header, so now replace #Time with #spaces
  - new switches 
      -finalcr will cause a CR to be added at end of display
      -hostformat  currently supports one option of char:pos
    see manpage for details

colplot
- no changes

4.8.1 September 2014

colplot
- pattern matching in a few places in colplotlib wasn't correctly dealing with
  files that had a name with a string of digits surrounded by hypens in their
  hostname portion
- update copyright with correct date range
- allow CPU filters to be expressed as ranges
- force vertical mode when links param set (which only done in tiny.ph) and
  comment out error test below which I don't even remember why is there!
- added L param to tiny.pl to allow disabling links from tiny plots
- added -lastmins to help (it was always available but I forgot to add it)
- was appending *.gz to globspec even if already ending in '*' which caused
  files to be found multiple times
- when plotting files with the 'last n-minutes' feature it continues to use
  the last modified timestamp on the file itself and so can plot files from
  the past.  however, it will now look at the timezone the file was generated
  in and if different than the local timezone will use the local times for
  that files x-axis, allowing you to mix files from different locations
  [thanks philippe]
- was not correctly stripping out fileroot for png files and so 'tab', etc
  was being included in png filename
- changed default plot directory to /var/log/collectl and if no date there colplot
  WILL still start but display a warning and set a maximum range from from/thru
  [thanks philippe]
- not all <label> tags had ending tags and that confused firefox [thanks philippe]
- need to NOT use space as default separator when splitting out column names
- -showplot wasn't properly sorting by subsys for html output
- make debug message missing data fields for mask 16 more explicit 

colmux
- strip leading whitespace in address file
- in single-line format remove domain name from host to aid in column naming
- clarifed help text for -hostwidth, which is actually a MINIMUM width not
  an absolute one
- new switches
  - colhelp puts column numbers over each column in multiline format
    to aid with column<RETURN> interactive command [thanks john]
  - colbin to allow running collectl from specific directory
  - colnodiv names the columns which NOT to apply any colk or col1000 to
    [thanks hank]
  - noescape eliminates all escape sequences from output [thanks hank]
- discovered looking for switch named colnodetflag instead of just colnodet
- added -sshkey to help output
- was not dealing correctly with multiline formatting for hosts < 9 chars wide

colgui
- removed from kit as promised

4.7.1  March 7, 2013

colplot
- dropped release notes older than 4.0.0 which are from 2006 and earlier
- no changes to colplot itself after 4.6.4
- the key attribute 'vertical' is only available starting with gnuplot
  V4.2 [thanks, Vishal]

colmux
- dropped release notes older than 3.0.0 which was a complete rewrite anyway
- add 'u' and 'd' as paging commands you can type interactively if you
  don't have TermReadKey installed
- new switch: -colhelp will include numbers on top of each colum in
  multi-line mode to help identify them for when you don't have TermReadKey
  in stalled [thanks, John]
- added colmux release notes from 3.4.2 after older colplot notes
- added -keepalive with will tell ssh to send periodic keepalives, preventing
  long-lived connections from timing out and losing connectivity [thanks Vishal]

3.3.1  Nov 10, 2012

colplot - 4.6.4
- allow + sign in directory name  [thanks philippe]
- new plots: loadavg, memdirty
- renamed tcp to tcpold and created new tcp to reflect new type of data
- added loadavg to sumall
- added new color clauses to 1st 10 line types in colplot.conf.  there will
  be ignored if gnuplot < v4
- only reduce plot width to 1 for PDFs [thanks greg]
- now supports plotting gz files, BUT also now required Compress::Zlib
- slight change to INSTALL to make sure apache2 always defined [thanks michey]
- new option in colplot.conf, deftimeframe, which allows you to control the 
  setting the from/thru dates, timeframe for last n-minutes, or neither noting
  large directories can take awhile to scan for the date range [thanks Vishal]
- added support for colplot.conf parameter containing = since, 
  eg deftimeframe=float=30

colmux - 3.4.1
- support for paging through displays with pageup/pagedown
- support for collectl versions < 3.5 officially dropped
- dropped -showcolver, added automatic checks against 1st node

- relaxed x11 check to ONLY cases where cli used w/o --filedir option
- make margins tighter when legend or x-axis turned off
- updated INSTALL/UNINSTALL to be deal with apache2 on debian
- when legend/xaxis suppressed, reduce corresponding margin sizes
- new experimental API to allow last minute modification of standard plotting params
  by specifying a file as an email subject, but only for a single plot type.  added
  tiny and oneperpage to kit as examples to experiment with
- allow -suffix after a plot filenames date/time
- removed divisor from memory field defs in colplotlib.defsand added to plots themselves, 
  making it possible to use GB for mem plot and MB for some of the individual ones like 
  membuf and memmap
- added mask of 32 to allow limiting  y-axis to %f.1 to make less cluttered even though some
  labels repeat
- made the spacing between labels in the legend a little tighter 1.0 -> .7 so they're more likely
  to fit in single column.
- changed disk/network plot setting so that disk read/writes are never divided by 1000 and
  network packets always are

4.6.2
- added mask of 18 to definitions for plots 'swap' and 'nfsmeta'
- added mask to output for debug=2
- sort detail plots by instance names [kevin - thanks for the push]
- can now add addition plot header/extension mappings to defs files
  using <extmaps> stanza
- added debug 2048 to colplotlib and enhanced debug 32 a little more too
- in colplotlib when writing to a pdf, you need to set the teminal type to
  postscript BEFORE setting the output filename
- added id/for to checkboxes so you can click on text as well [thanks justin]

4.6.1   Nov  2, 2010
- see changes to colplotlib.defs
- see changes to colplotlib.phanksh
- changed behavior for 'contains'
  - default set to ANY
  - if 'contains' contains a '[', ignore any/all and treat as a pdsh expression
- added nvidia plot definitions

4.5.1   July 24, 2010
- is 'anyall' or 'contains' used as argument take them as field defaults
- changed default directory to /var/log/collectl as a number of users prefer this
  to the example plot directory.  the 'getting started' topic in the FAQ was
  updated accordingly
- don't require ghostscript for png files, fixed error check
- deal with $email format of /dir/prefix and validate against dir

4.4.2   April 26, 2010
- need to divide the read/write KBs for disk data by 1024 in colplotlib.defs

4.4.1   December 15, 2009
- clarified copyright notice
- set $LibDir to binary directory if colplotlib.ph is there, otherwise look in
  /usr/share/collectl

4.4.0	August 21, 2009
- open source release

4.3.2	July 21, 2009
- if plotting by points, set plot type to thickness-1 since we can't change the size of default
  style 0 and DO want that when thick=1
- changed message "No files matching your selections were found" to more clearly state the
  situation
- if multiple detail files for same day were generated by using -ou and the configuration changed
  (currently this is only an issues with polyserve), colplot WILL correctly select the correct
  column numbers for each individual file, something it couldn't do before.

4.3.1   April 28, 2009
- support for remote plotting
  - 2 new switches: -addr and -href
  - new plot type of 'tty' which prints png file to tty
- removed all print statements from -help routine
- upgrade to support gnuplot 4.2, which sets canvas size in 'set terminal' and
  hardcodes 'set size 1,1'
- rookie bug - wasn't NOT masking the mask variabe with 1 so it wouldn't pick up
  any other setting.
- added new switch/webfield, thick to change thickness of plot line (so I can see it!)

4.2.1   March 15, 2009
- change to colplotlib.ph

4.2.0   January 29, 2009
- when running gnuplot on a pc, can't echo a 'set terminal' command and so we have
  to just assume png and x11 are builtin, which they seem to be with 4.2
- 2 newplots - faults and paging
- added swap in/out to swap
- added all 3 to allsum

4.1.5   December 17, 2008
- updated colplot main help file

- added new environmentatl plot, Power
- added date range to debug code in findFiles()
- new switch for cli, --lastmins which specifies the last minutes of data to plot
  either just prior to the last file access time OR overridden with --time.  Only
- caveat for --time is you can't specify a begin time so you need something like
  "-hh:mm" in quote so the leading - doesn't look like a switch

4.1.3   October 9, 2008
- added options for Fans and Temps
- see RELEASE-collectl-utils

4.1.2   ???
- updated a few definitions in colplotlib.defs
- name of nfs detail plot wrong.  changed it from nfsd to detnfs
- made error message about missing column name in plot file more explicit
- fixed bug in live move which caused error when crossing an hour boundary
- add from date to plot display header and if different add 'thru' as well

4.1.1   Feb 29, 2008
- added new plot types for cpu to include irs, soft, steal and intrpt
  (only changes to colplotlib.defs)

4.1.0	Feb 08, 2008
- make sure gnuplot suppots png/x11 graphics for type in invocation and
  include with -v status

4.0.2 	Nov 19, 2007
- changed ambiguous 'type -h for help' message to 'type -help...'
- was not correctly setting 'unique' on initial call to findFiles which in some 
  cases [still not entirely understood] caused an infinite loop in that routine
- had wrong name for default Lustre plots.  Should have been 'sumlus' not 'lustre'
- changed units on lustre client and OST plot data to MB instead of KB

4.0.1 	Jul 13, 2007
- enhanced some error messages
- changed nfs summary plot name, which doesn't exist, to 'sumnfs'
- fixed colplotlib.ph to handle nested macros as long as defined in right order
- nested some macros in colplotlib.defs
- when both divisors the same (ctx/int) and mulitple of 1000, append multiplier
  to title
- by default, select plot file with unique or date-stamped name formats based 
  on the type of the first one that matches selection criteria.  this behavior
  can be overridden in the CLI with -unique or -nounique
- changed search order to look for 'conf' file in current dictory, then that
  where the binary is located and finally /etc
- if you run collectl on lustre server nodes with -L to force node type(s) you 
  could end up with columns that contain only 0s if that type of service not
  running and colplot then generates empty plots.  colplotlib has been modified to
  ignore such plots
- installation now supports standard redhat/suse apache configurations
- for hosts in a cluster that end in a variable width numeric, ensure they
  collate in the correct order
- wan't picking up -ylog in command line mode

- changed user-defined plotting mechanism
- replaced sample files with different ones

- need to do double-buffering with real-time data since the pointers can
  change if a new sample comes in before old sample printed
- new switch: -hostwidth, sets the minimum host name size.  This may be
  necessary when using alaises that are shorter than hostname which themselves
  longer than the default width
- fixed problem of not dealing with non-time options correctly
- added -username which will set this as initial username for ALL hosts
  you can still override for individual hosts with @
- fixed code that checks for missing samples in real-time, single line format
  to deal with crossing midnight [thanks hank]
- had to extend timeout for pings because on failures there were issues with good nodes
  connecting back
- need to check for verbose import for remapping header in real-time display
- include '-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -q' with all ssh commands in case host entry
  missing from known_hosts and to suppress motd [thanks bob]
- fixed problem playing back data from multiple hosts on same local machine

  of collectl presence and so renamed '-noping' to '-nocheck'
- new switch, -showcolver, will cause all remore nodes to print their name/collectl
  version and exit.
- extend checking for excluding multiple systems when detail data present to include
  imported modules containing ',d'
- headers not printing correctly when just doing --import whether 's' or 'd'

Version 3.1.0
- cleaned up misleading error messages when trying to specify a host/date/time
  fields with --cols

Version 3.0.0  Jan 4, 2011
